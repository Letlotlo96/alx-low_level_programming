0X03-Debugging project

Tasks:
1. 0. Multiple mains (In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project).
2. 1. Like, comment, subscribe (Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop).
3. 2. 0 > 972? (This program prints the largest of three integers).
4. 3. Leap year (This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration).
